# Little trickey
**Cases**
1. If Cycle is present.
2. If Indegree is two.
3. if cycle is present and indegree is also two
​
​
`3rd case is a bit trickey is cycle is present and indegree is also 2 for some node, just check when this cycle egde encounter then if indegree is two return the edge which causes both indegree two and cycle.`
​
This case is simple to deal with but problem occurs when the order of edges is changed therefore keep it in mind.
